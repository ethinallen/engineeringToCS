# engineeringToCS

My name is Drew Emery and I'm going into my last year of Industrial Engineering at Clemson university. I'm making this repository to help provide some resources for those wishing to dive into the realm of Computer Science that need some direction. This repository is constantly changing and will more than likely never be complete. I hope that it is able to provide some help and everyone is free to contact me with questions.
