# engineeringToCS
My personal guide to CS for engineering students.


Does the following describe you?   
`I'm engineering but I want to learn some CS!`
## Then this is the place for you!

There are lots of applications for coding, so why let CS have all of the fun? Engineers have a lot of useful applications for code but it can often seem daunting to the uninitiated. If I had to learn it all from scratch this is how I would do it!

#### [Learn Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL3yq5a_vNM&list=PLlcnQQJK8SUjfkCph45fz6rC0de60LVZR)
1. What is a unix / linux system?
  - Brief history of operating systems
  -`this is dumb we should use windows` <~~~ No ma'am / sir
  - Tour of a linux server (ssh into raspberry pi)
2. Why Linux?
   - Easy to set up and develop on
   - Easy to set up a new machine to run the same code as your machine
   - Most servers are linux based;
     - knowing how to navigate and use linux machines enales one to do a lot more with code

- Learn Git!
  - Git is a brilliant way to share more than just code! It is a super useful way to collaborate on any file and can make transferring projects between machines very painless.
  - You're going to need it to collaborate
  - The better you are at it, the longer you can go before merging the wrong thing and making your coworkers really upset with you!
