# engineeringToCS
My personal guide to CS for engineering students.


Does the following describe you?   
`I'm engineering but I want to learn some CS!`
## Then this is the place for you!

There are lots of applications for coding, so why let CS have all of the fun? Engineers have a lot of useful applications for code but it can often seem daunting to the uninitiated. If I had to learn it all from scratch this is how I would do it!
