## In the beginning there was Unix

The story has to start somewhere and I have chosen to start at the Unix operating system. If there are any purists out there that would rather me delve deeper into the history of operating systems... Email me and you can contribute.

Things to consider when envisioning the origin of these operating systems:
- A single computer used to serve an entire university
- Computer scientists had to write all of their code and bring it to a massive

Unix: Originally names `Unics`
  - was a pun on the name `Multics`
    - Multics was the operating system before Unix
    - Multics had the innovative idea of attempting to serve multiple users at once
    - this would enable more than one computer scientist to interact with the machine at once
    - Multics was supposed to be able to have 1000 users logged in at once [it could barely handle 3]
  - Unics became `Unix` when it was able to support 2 simultaneous users at once
