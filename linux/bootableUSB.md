### General knowledge   

Okay, I understand that you may not be 'gung ho' to mess up your hard drive making a partition for linux or you may not have the space. I think that making a bootable USB is a fantastic alternative. It's going to enable you to learn the linux system with very minimal risk. If you completely brick this operating system, all you have to do is write a new image to your usb and you're good to keep learning. It also means that you don't have to worry about messing up the partition on your machine and hurting whatever data you may have on the Windows side. This will also give you the opportunity to try different distributions of Linux very easily.

1. Install [balenaetcher]('https://www.balena.io/etcher/')
   - balenaEtcher takes an 'image' of an operating system and write it to a thumb drive
   - the result is a thumb drive that acts exactly like another partition on your hard drive
2. [Download an image]('https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=267')
   - I went ahead and recommended [Linux Mint]('https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=267') because that's what I use and I do not have any qualms with it
